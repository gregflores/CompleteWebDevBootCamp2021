One question
Left lawn across the campus
how will people walk to each building
People trotted on the grass
Creating their own paths
They then lay the stone paths along the grass paths

UX should be invisible
Keep it Simple
Consistency
Keep the design similar across the website\

F pattern
Z pattern

All platform design
Has to work for more than just a desktop computer
Needs to work for mobile

Also works the other way around
