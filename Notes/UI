Hierarchy

Use Colors
contrasting colors will draw your eyes

size
Bigger items will draw your eyes
HEADER is big right? Read that first.
Conversions, get people to click that button

Wikipedia is an example of bad design
Just blocks of text
Long blocks of text is hard to track
40-60 characters per line is about what would look good.

Alignment
Try to keep things aligned
Reduce number of alignment points


White Space
Empty space around elements
Luxury shops add whitespace around products. Makes things look expensive.
Same applies to digital design
Less clutter, add some whitespace, and it looks better

Audience
Wouldn't use a black and white design for a childrens party invitation
Always target your Audience
